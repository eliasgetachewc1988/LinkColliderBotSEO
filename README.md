Step 1: Install Java - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

Step 2: Modify the bat file with your email and password

Step 3: Run the bat file!


* save this file as link_collider.py (you can name it whatever you want, I say that just for the sake of instruction)
* open cmd.exe
* type in "pip install bs4 requests argparse" (without the quotes)
* create a new file called "accounts.txt"
* format the accounts as such : Username|Password|proxy
* if you're not using a proxy then this format : Username|Password|none
* type in "python link_collider.py" (do this in the active directory, you can hold shift and right click in the folder the script is in to open cmd.exe in that folder)
* It will start running all of your accounts provided
